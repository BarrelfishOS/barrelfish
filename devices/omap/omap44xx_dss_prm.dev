 * NOTE: This file has been automatically generated based on the
 * XML files extracted from the TI RDT v1.0.0.4p Tool.
 * Download from here: http://www.ti.com/product/omap4460
 * This means that the file might not be optimal in terms of naming
 * conventions for constants and registers (duplicated
 * namespaces in register and device name etc.).
 * Also, because of the underlying structure from the original XML
 * it's possible that some constants appear multiple times (if they
 * have slightly different descriptions for example).
 *
 * You want to clean that up before using the files for the first time!
