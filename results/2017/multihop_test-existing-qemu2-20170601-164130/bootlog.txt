Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape- descended life
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
are a pretty neat idea.

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the
people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions
were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned
with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because
on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most
of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that
even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have
left the oceans.

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had
been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people
for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth
suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time,
and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy
place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to
get nailed to anything.
