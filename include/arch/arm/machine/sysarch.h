/*
 * The ARM_TP_ADDRESS points to a special purpose page, which is used as local
 * store for the ARM per-thread data and Restartable Atomic Sequences support.
 * Put it just above the "high" vectors' page.
 * The cpu_switch() code assumes ARM_RAS_START is ARM_TP_ADDRESS + 4, and
 * ARM_RAS_END is ARM_TP_ADDRESS + 8, so if that ever changes, be sure to
 * update the cpu_switch() (and cpu_throw()) code as well.
 * In addition, code in arm/include/atomic.h and arm/arm/exception.S
 * assumes that ARM_RAS_END is at ARM_RAS_START+4, so be sure to update those
 * if ARM_RAS_END moves in relation to ARM_RAS_START (look for occurrences
 * of ldr/str rm,[rn, #4]).
