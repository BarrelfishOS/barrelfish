Guidelines for code reviewing
=============================

This document briefly outlines the kind of things which should be looked for
when reviewing code for the ECLiPSe system.

- Is the code documented?  Is this documentation up-to-date?
- Is the code clear?
- If there are (unavoidably) tricky or subtle things happening in the code,
  are they sufficiently well explained in the documentation?
- Is there anything you don't understand?
- Is the change complete?  (E.g. are there other parts of the system which
  should also be updated?)
- Do you see any bugs?
- Is there anything which might adversely affect maintenance or reliability
  in the future?  (Error cases not handled, use of hard-coded numbers
  instead of symbolic constants, etc.)
- Does appropriate user documentation exist?  Is it up-to-date?
- If the change is a bug fix, are there tests for the bug?
- If the change adds or extends functionality, are there adequate tests for
  the new or extended features?
- Was the CVS log message appropriate?
