\section{The Abstract Syntax}

In this module, we define the combinators to embed the Flounder
language into Haskell. So, we will mix the design the Abstract-Syntax
Tree with the definition of some handy combinators.

> module Syntax where


\subsection{Interface Header}


First, we define the abstract syntax of our embedded language. At the
top-level is the \emph{interface} definition. It consists of a @name@
and, potentially, a @description@. It contains a list of
\emph{declarations}.

> data Interface = Interface String (Maybe String) [ Declaration ] 
>
> generalInterface :: Maybe String -> String -> [ Declaration ] -> Interface
> generalInterface description name declarations = 
>     Interface name description declarations

Which can be further refined into an anonymous interface, ie. with no
description:

> aInterface :: String -> [Declaration] -> Interface
> aInterface = generalInterface Nothing

And, the more common, a documented interface:

> interface :: String -> String -> [Declaration] -> Interface
> interface name description declarations = 
>     generalInterface (Just description) name declarations

Finally, various getters:

> interfaceName :: Interface -> String
> interfaceName (Interface name _ _) = name

\subsection{Declarations}

A declaration is either a \emph{type definition} or a \emph{message
definition}. In the next subsections, we define these terms in turn.

> data Declaration = Typedef TypeDef
>                  | Messagedef MessageDef


\subsubsection{Declaring types}


We can define new types out of existing ones thanks to five
constructs:
\begin{description}
        \item[Structure:] like C @struct@, it defines a name-indexed record
        \item[Array:] defines a static array of elements of a given type
        \item[Enumeration:] like C @enum@, defines a sum-type over some elements
        \item[Alias:] redefine the name of an already defined type
\end{description}

> data TypeDef = TStruct String [StructField]
>              | TArray TypeRef String Integer
>              | TEnum String [String] 
>              | TAlias String TypeRef
>              | TAliasT String TypeBuiltin

In this definition, we notice the presence of @TypeRef@: indeed, when
we construct a new type, it can use either built-in types, such as
@uint8_t@, or previously defined types, identified by their name.

> data TypeRef = Builtin TypeBuiltin
>              | TypeVar String
>              | TypeAlias String TypeBuiltin
>     deriving (Show)

The builtin types being:

> data TypeBuiltin = UInt8
>                  | UInt16
>                  | UInt32
>                  | UInt64
>                  | UIntPtr
>                  | Int8
>                  | Int16
>                  | Int32
>                  | Int64
>                  | IntPtr
>                  | Size
>                  | Char
>                  | Bool
>                  | String
>                  | IRef
>                  | Cap
>                  | GiveAwayCap
>                  | ErrVal
>                    deriving (Enum, Eq)

Which are shown with:

> instance Show TypeBuiltin where
>     show UInt8 = "uint8"
>     show UInt16 = "uint16"
>     show UInt32 = "uint32"
>     show UInt64 = "uint64"
>     show UIntPtr = "uintptr"
>     show Int8 = "int8"
>     show Int16 = "int16"
>     show Int32 = "int32"
>     show Int64 = "int64"
>     show IntPtr = "intptr"
>     show Size = "size"
>     show Bool = "bool"
>     show String = "string"
>     show Char = "char"
>     show IRef = "iref"
>     show Cap = "cap"
>     show GiveAwayCap = "give_away_cap"
>     show ErrVal = "errval"

> instance Read TypeBuiltin where
>     readsPrec _ = \s -> case s of 
>                                "uint8" -> [(UInt8, "")]
>                                "uint16" -> [(UInt16, "")]
>                                "uint32" -> [(UInt32, "")]
>                                "uint64" -> [(UInt64, "")]
>                                "uintptr" -> [(UIntPtr, "")]
>                                "int8" -> [(Int8, "")]
>                                "int16" -> [(Int16, "")]
>                                "int32" -> [(Int32, "")]
>                                "int64" -> [(Int64, "")]
>                                "intptr" -> [(IntPtr, "")]
>                                "int" -> [(Int32, "")] -- XXX: why? -AB
>                                "size" -> [(Size, "")]
>                                "bool" -> [(Bool, "")]
>                                "string" -> [(String, "")]
>                                "char" -> [(Char, "")]
>                                "iref" -> [(IRef, "")]
>                                "cap" -> [(Cap, "")]
>                                "give_away_cap" -> [(GiveAwayCap, "")]
>                                "errval" -> [(ErrVal, "")]
>                                _ -> error  $ "Undefined builtin type " ++ s

Hence, we can define:

> isBuiltin :: TypeRef -> Bool
> isBuiltin (Builtin _) = True
> isBuiltin _ = False

And the usual combinators:

> uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr :: TypeRef
> uint8 = Builtin UInt8
> uint16 = Builtin UInt16
> uint32 = Builtin UInt32
> uint64 = Builtin UInt64
> uintptr = Builtin UIntPtr

> int8, int16, int32, int64, intptr :: TypeRef
> int8 = Builtin Int8
> int16 = Builtin Int16
> int32 = Builtin Int32
> int64 = Builtin Int64
> intptr = Builtin IntPtr

> size, string, iref, cap, give_away_cap :: TypeRef
> size = Builtin Size
> string = Builtin String
> iref = Builtin IRef
> cap = Builtin Cap
> give_away_cap = Builtin GiveAwayCap

> var :: String -> TypeRef
> var typeRef = TypeVar typeRef

> als :: String -> TypeBuiltin -> TypeRef
> als typeRef origin = TypeAlias typeRef origin

Then, we can build a type definition out of these special cases with:

> typedef :: TypeDef -> Declaration
> typedef typeDefinition = Typedef typeDefinition



Here's a utility function to resolve a named type (which may be an alias) to
its canonical definition:

> lookup_type_name :: [TypeDef] -> String -> TypeDef
> lookup_type_name types name = case def of
>         -- FIXME: these types seem a bit confusing -AB
>         -- why are there so many ways to specify an alias of a builtin?
>         (TAlias _ (Builtin b)) -> TAliasT name b
>         (TAlias _ (TypeVar v)) -> lookup_type_name types v
>         (TAlias _ (TypeAlias _ b)) -> TAliasT name b
>         d -> d
>     where
>         -- I'm assuming there must be exactly one definition for the type name
>         def
>             | null defs = error $ "lookup_type_name: " ++ name ++ " not defined"
>             | null $ tail defs = head defs
>             | otherwise = error $ "lookup_type_name: " ++ name ++ " multiply defined"
>         defs = [t | t <- types, typedef_name t == name]
> 
>         typedef_name :: TypeDef -> String
>         typedef_name (TStruct n _) = n
>         typedef_name (TArray _ n _) = n
>         typedef_name (TEnum n _) = n
>         typedef_name (TAlias n _) = n
>         typedef_name (TAliasT n _) = n

As above, but for a TypeRef:

> lookup_typeref :: [TypeDef] -> TypeRef -> TypeDef
> lookup_typeref _ (Builtin b) = TAliasT (show b) b
> lookup_typeref _ (TypeAlias n b) = TAliasT n b
> lookup_typeref types (TypeVar v) = lookup_type_name types v



\paragraph{Structure}

So, a @struct@ is identified by its @name@, which, as in C, comes
after a list of @fields@.

> struct :: [StructField] -> String -> TypeDef
> struct fields name = TStruct name fields

The fields of a structure consist of a type @typeField@ associated
with a field @name@.

> data StructField = TStructField TypeRef String
>
> field, (.@@.) :: TypeRef -> String -> StructField
> field typeField name = TStructField typeField name
> (.@@.) = field

\paragraph{Array}

An array is identified by a @name@ and defined by the type of its
elements, @typeElts@, as well as its length.

> array :: TypeRef -> String -> Integer -> TypeDef
> array typeElts name length = TArray typeElts name length

\paragraph{Enumeration}

An enumeration is, as always, identified by a @name@. The content of
an enumeration is a list of tags, the @elements@.

> enum :: [String] -> String -> TypeDef
> enum elements name = TEnum name elements

\paragraph{Aliasing}

Finally, we can do type aliasing: we can give a @newName@ to a type,
which was previously known as @originalName@. Note that the names are
switched between the combinator and the data-type.

> alias :: TypeRef -> String -> TypeDef
> alias originalName newName = TAlias newName originalName



\subsubsection{Declaring a Message}


A @message@ is identified by a @name@ and is either a @Call@, a
@Response@, or it is a @Message@, in all generality. A message can
carry some arguments, which are described by a list of
@MessageArgument@, in @msgArgs@. Hence the following definition:

> data MessageDef = Message MessageType String [ MessageArgument ] [(String, [(String, MetaArgument)])]
>                 | RPC String [ RPCArgument ] [(String, [(String, MetaArgument)])]
>
> data MessageType = MMessage 
>                  | MCall
>                  | MResponse
>
> message, call, response :: String -> [ MessageArgument ] -> Declaration
> message name args = Messagedef $ Message MMessage name args []
> call name args = Messagedef $ Message MCall name args []
> response name args = Messagedef $ Message MResponse name args []

As for the arguments passed to a message, they are simply the type @typeArg@ and
the @identifier@ of the argument:

> data MessageArgument = Arg TypeRef Variable
>     deriving (Show)
>
> data Variable = Name String
>               | DynamicArray String String
>     deriving (Show)
>
> arg, (.@.) :: TypeRef -> String -> MessageArgument
> arg typeArg identifier = Arg typeArg (Name identifier)
> (.@.) = arg
>
> argDynamic, (.#.) :: TypeRef -> (String, String) -> MessageArgument
> argDynamic typeArg (identifier, length) = Arg typeArg (DynamicArray identifier length)
> (.#.) = argDynamic 

And we are done for message definitions.

Concerning RPC, the RPC arguments take into account whether a
parameter is used \emph{in} or \emph{out}.

> data RPCArgument = RPCArgIn TypeRef Variable
>                  | RPCArgOut TypeRef Variable

The meta-parameters allow passing additional information to individual
backends. The paramaters are a mapping from names to either an identifier,
which should match a message argument, or a value:

> data MetaArgument = BackendInt Integer
>                   | BackendMsgArg String
