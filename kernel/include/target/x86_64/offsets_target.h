/**
 * \file
 * \brief X86-64 address space sizes and offsets
 *
 * The layout of the x86-64 virtual address space can be summarized as
 * follows:
 *
 *<pre>
 * +----------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
 * | User-space                                         | Physical memory |
 * | PML4 entries: 0 1 2 3 4 ... 510                    | 511             |
 * +----------------------------------------------------+-----------------+</pre>
 *
 * User-space maps user-space programs. Physical memory maps all
 * available physical memory (up to PADDR_SPACE_LIMIT).
 *
 * This partition is static and can only be changed at compile-time.
 *
 * Physical memory can grow downwards, towards user-space, although it
 * is expected to stay within PML4 entry 511 for quite some time (one
 * PML4 entry can map 512 GBytes). The rest of the address space can
 * be freely mapped by (possibly multiple) user-space programs.
