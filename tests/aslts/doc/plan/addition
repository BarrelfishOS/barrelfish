Free layout to record remarks about additional tests
to be done ever (some remarks can be obsolete).
====================================================

1. See file aslts/NOTE for the issues to be verified.

2. At present, no tests which automatically verify the constant folding.
   The tests can be implemented basing on:
   - analyzing the output of AML disassembler
   - our "Test Command Interface with the ACPI
     implementation (_TCI)" instrumentation

3. It seems that we have no simple tests for
   Store/Copy without expected conversions:
   String -->> String
   Buffer -->> Buffer
   Package -->> Package
   ...

4. http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5490
   check exception AE_AML_METHOD_LIMIT

   checking of AE_AML_METHOD_LIMIT limits (32 and 256)
   should be performed in a separate tests.

5. Do the tests which will show that inappropreate bit-sizes are applied.
   For example, exoparg2.c: Operand[0]->Buffer.Length - 32-bit
   while "ACPI_SIZE  Length" - 16/32/64.
   Bug 124 was about something like that.

6. Multi-threading (now (07.07.2006) started, in progress)
   to check different functionality of ACPICA in the
   multi-threading conditions.

7. Continue mt-tests.

8. Compare the raw performance of the two interpreters (MS and ACPICA).
