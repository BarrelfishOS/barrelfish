bdemostabs
===========

The utility bdemostabs calculates the current state of all bugs
and reports the summary tables.

The input data of bdemostabs are as follow.

  arg1 - the first multi-result directory
  arg2 - the second multi-result directory
  arg3 - ALLBUGS file which is a manually prepared description of all bugs,
         those features of current state of bugs which could not be obtained
         automatically. NOTE: it should be kept up to date regularly.
  arg4 - kernel bugzilla Bug List file
  arg5 - local bugzilla Bug List file


Error opcodes in 'Errors' field of Table 1
==========================================

The 'Errors' field of the summary table (Table 1) contains the letter opcodes
of errors which points out the inconsistences of the particular bug state which
require working on them. See opcodes of errors enumerated in ERROR_OPCODES file.


ALLBUGS file manual description of per-bug state
================================================

One new line is to be added into this file for each new bug.
The contents of fields of the line are given below.
COMP    - component the bug relates to:
            I    - AML Interpreter
            C    - iASL compiler
            M    - simulation purposes (OS Layer insertions for simulation purposes only)
            U    - utility
            S    - specs
            ML   - memory leak (additional information but not component)
IID     - internal ID of bug
LBZID   - local bugzilla ID
KBZID   - kernel bugzilla ID
PR      - priority for fixing the bug. Should be non-empty for each not fixed
          bug and empty otherwise:
            1 - will be fixed in the first turn
            2 - will be fixed in the second turn..
SUMMARY - summary. Short description of bug.

STATE-MANUALLY - the state of bug set up/confirmed (if needed) manually:
          FIXED      - bug is fixed. It is to be filled only when there is no
                       ability to create the relevant bdemo test which shows
                       the current state of the bug.
          REJECTED   - no longer a bug. Each rejected bug should be confirmed
                       by this entry here.
          INTEGRATED - bug-fix is olready integrated. Each fixed bug should be
                       confirmed by this entry here that its patch/update is
                       integrated into ACPICA.

Discipline of setting up INTEGRATED
into STATE-MANUALLY of ALLBUGS file
===================================

1. If bug fix is proposed by our side we check
   manually through the code that bug fix is actually
   integrated into ACPICA code.

2. If bug is fixed by other side we dont know where to look for
   the relevant update and simply run the relevant bdemo test on
   the obtained release to ensure the bug-fix is already integrated.

3. For bugs of internal bugzilla other side sets RESOLVED FIXED when
   integrated the bug-fix update but doesn't close the relevant bug.
   We run the bdemo test check the result of the test and set CLOSED
   when the test results in PASS.

4. CLOSED but not INTEGRATED yet bug is considered as a wrong combination.
