   Set up the particular desirable set of tests to be run
   (have effect only when running a group of test cases or
   even collections) such as all Functional tests, all Complex
   tests, all Exceptions tests or Full test (all enumerated
   above tests) compiled all as one DefinitionBlock.
   See additional comments in runmode.asl file.

   2. Variables which disable/enable pieces of tests.

   This serves different purposes - to prevent crashes,
   hangs, and so on. All these variables must be finally
   set to non-zero - so enabling all the excluded now tests.
