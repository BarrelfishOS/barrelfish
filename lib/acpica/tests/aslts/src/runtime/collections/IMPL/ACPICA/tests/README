   the tests dependent on ACPICA internal features


dynobj

   The ASL Dynamical Object support tests.
   The tests reflects the current dynamic of using memory
   during interpretation of different ASL expressions and
   reports deviation (if any) from the expected structure
   of memory to be consumed in that process.



NOTE:

   The test dynobj requires the Test Command Interface with
   the ACPI implementation (_TCI) to be supported. In case,
   _TCI is not supported, the test reports the message and
   exits with PASS.
