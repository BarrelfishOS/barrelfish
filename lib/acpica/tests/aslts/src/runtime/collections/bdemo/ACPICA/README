CONTENTS

   The tests to demonstrate the encountered bugs of ACPICA and
   prove their actual fixes. Pass of the test means the relevant
   bug has been fixed. All the useful additional tests designed
   during the work on bug fixes and related to those bug's nearest
   conditions could be accumulated here as well.

N      - internal number of bug

N_ASL  - demo test for iASL type bug,
         no .aml result code is expected or produced,
         nothing to verify in run-mode.
         Should be checked separately by running iASl
         and checking the result of compilation.

N_SPEC - bug of specification

N_ML   - demo test for Memory leak type bug,
         usually contains the program allowing to compare
         (to visually observe) the rate of execution before
         and after fixing the bug

N      - independing on the actual component producing bug #N there
         is an .aml result code of compilation of test which performs
         some operations and verifies their results, so should be run.
         PASS result of run means the bug #N has been fixed.

ASL_RUNTIME

       - when bug of iASL has been fixed add this test to bdemo/bdemo
         to run it too

ACTION_REQUIRED

       - could not be run automatically,
         to check this bug-fix some actions are required

DEMO_IMPOSSIBLE

       - impossible to verify bug-fix, so no demo test provided

bdemo

   to compile all the bdemo tests as one DefinitionBlock

bdemof

   to compile all the bdemof tests as one DefinitionBlock

   The tests require utilyzing of the -f option on the ASL
   compilation stage.

   ASL Compiler:

      -f  -  Ignore errors, force creation of AML output file(s)
