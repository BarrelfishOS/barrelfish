    This service-test reports failures when some conditional branches,
    which were introduced for to exclude code causing crashes or hangs or
    other troubles are disabled (the relevant variables are set to zero).
    This is for to remind of that bug-fixes are needed and not to forget
    to enable finally these branches of tests) and is some criteria of
    completeness - all or not all branches of tests were executed.
