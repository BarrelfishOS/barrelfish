   tests to prove identity of ACPICA to MS

abbu

   Tests applicable to both AcpiExec and MS-abbu utilities

   Interface of these tests allows them both to be run
   by AcpiExec utility as elements of ASLTS test suite
   and by abbu utility under MS.

   Due to the current incomplete implementation of ACPI
   by MS the entire ASLTS test suite can't simply be run
   by abbu utility under MS.

   This test case is intended to accumulate tests which
   exercise and verify the fundamental ACPI features.
   The tests should succeed on both AcpiExec and abbu
   and thus prove identity of ACPICA and MS.
