How to install the AML tests
----------------------------


There are two ways to install the AML tests in a Unix-like environment:

1.  > cd aslts
    > make install

2.  > aslts/bin/Do 0 aslts

where 'aslts' is the root directory of the test suite. The base name must
be exactly 'aslts'.

The generated tests will be located in the aslts/tmp/aml parent directory
which is created automatically by make-install.

The actual AML code of the individual ASL tests are placed in the following
subdirectories:

   With compiler optimization:

       aslts/tmp/aml/opt/32
       aslts/tmp/aml/opt/64

   Without compiler optimization:

       aslts/tmp/aml/nopt/32
       aslts/tmp/aml/nopt/64

If the directories aslts/tmp/aml/* do not exist they are automatically
created.

ENVIRONMENT

   For test generation, the envirnoment variable 'ASL' should be set to the
   pathname of the iASL compiler.

        For example, for cygwin under windows:

            > export ASL="c:/acpica/libraries/iasl.exe"


   For test execution, two additional variables are required:

        acpiexec - path to acpiexec utility: (example)

            > export acpiexec="c:/acpica/libraries/acpiexec.exe"

        ASLTSDIR - path to the aslts directory: (example)

            > export ASLTSDIR="c:/acpica/tests/aslts"
