 * random.c:
 *
 * An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
 * rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
 * interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
 * bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
 * then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
 * that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
 * information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
 * calling the setstate() routine with the same array as was initiallized
 * with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
 * information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
 * congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
 * 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.
 *
 * Internally, the state information is treated as an array of uint32_t's; the
 * zeroeth element of the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small
 * integer); the remainder of the array is the state information for the
 * R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of state information will give 7 ints worth of
 * state information, which will allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note:
 * the zeroeth word of state information also has some other information
 * stored in it -- see setstate() for details).
 *
 * The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift register
 * approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms to sum up that
 * way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all the numbers in
 * the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register, and will
 * have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial being
 * used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).  The
 * higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are also
 * influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The total
 * period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling
 * the amount of state information has a vast influence on the period of the
 * generator.  Note: the deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation only good for
 * large deg, when the period of the shift is the dominant factor.
 * With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much longer than the
 * 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.
 *
 * Modified 28 December 1994 by Jacob S. Rosenberg.
 * The following changes have been made:
 * All references to the type u_int have been changed to unsigned long.
 * All references to type int have been changed to type long.  Other
 * cleanups have been made as well.  A warning for both initstate and
 * setstate has been inserted to the effect that on Sparc platforms
 * the 'arg_state' variable must be forced to begin on word boundaries.
 * This can be easily done by casting a long integer array to char *.
 * The overall logic has been left STRICTLY alone.  This software was
 * tested on both a VAX and Sun SpacsStation with exactly the same
 * results.  The new version and the original give IDENTICAL results.
 * The new version is somewhat faster than the original.  As the
 * documentation says:  "By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of
 * state information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
 * congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
 * 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used."  For a buffer of
 * 128 bytes, this new version runs about 19 percent faster and for a 16
 * byte buffer it is about 5 percent faster.
 */

/*
 * For each of the currently supported random number generators, we have a
 * break value on the amount of state information (you need at least this
 * many bytes of state info to support this random number generator), a degree
 * for the polynomial (actually a trinomial) that the R.N.G. is based on, and
 * the separation between the two lower order coefficients of the trinomial.
