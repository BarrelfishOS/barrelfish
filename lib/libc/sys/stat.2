.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm stat ,
.Nm lstat ,
.Nm fstat ,
.Nm fstatat
.Nd get file status
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn stat "const char * restrict path" "struct stat * restrict sb"
.Ft int
.Fn lstat "const char * restrict path" "struct stat * restrict sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstat "int fd" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatat "int fd" "const char *path" "struct stat *buf" "int flag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stat
system call obtains information about the file pointed to by
.Fa path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be searchable.
.Pp
The
.Fn lstat
system call is like
.Fn stat
except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.Fn lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.Fn stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.Pp
The
.Fn fstat
system call obtains the same information about an open file
known by the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fn fstatat
system call is equivalent to
.Fn stat
and
.Fn lstat
except in the case where the
.Fa path
specifies a relative path.
In this case the status is retrieved from a file relative to
the directory associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
.Pp
The values for the
.Fa flag
are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list,
defined in
.In fcntl.h :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If
.Fa path
names a symbolic link, the status of the symbolic link is returned.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fn fstatat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the current working directory is used and the behavior is
identical to a call to
.Fn stat
or
.Fn lstat
respectively, depending on whether or not the
.Dv AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
bit is set in
.Fa flag .
.Pp
The
.Fa sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Vt stat
structure
as defined by
.In sys/stat.h
and into which information is placed concerning the file.
.Pp
The fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
related to the file system are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_nlink"
.It Va st_dev
The numeric ID of the device containing the file.
.It Va st_ino
The file's inode number.
.It Va st_nlink
The number of hard links to the file.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va st_dev
and
.Va st_ino
fields together identify the file uniquely within the system.
.Pp
The time-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_birthtim"
.It Va st_atim
Time when file data last accessed.
Changed by the
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr readv 2
system calls.
.It Va st_mtim
Time when file data last modified.
Changed by the
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr write 2
and
.Xr writev 2
system calls.
.It Va st_ctim
Time when file status was last changed (inode data modification).
Changed by the
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr chmod 2 ,
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr creat 2 ,
.Xr link 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr rename 2 ,
.Xr rmdir 2 ,
.Xr symlink 2 ,
.Xr truncate 2 ,
.Xr unlink 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
.Xr write 2
and
.Xr writev 2
system calls.
.It Va st_birthtim
Time when the inode was created.
.El
.Pp
The following time-related macros are defined for compatibility:
.Bd -literal
#define	st_atime		st_atim.tv_sec
#define	st_mtime		st_mtim.tv_sec
#define	st_ctime		st_ctim.tv_sec
#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE
#define	st_birthtime		st_birthtim.tv_sec
#endif

#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE
#define	st_atimespec		st_atim
#define	st_mtimespec		st_mtim
#define	st_ctimespec		st_ctim
#define	st_birthtimespec	st_birthtim
#endif
.Ed
.Pp
The size-related fields of the
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_blksize"
.It Va st_size
The file size in bytes.
.It Va st_blksize
The optimal I/O block size for the file.
.It Va st_blocks
The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte units.
As short symbolic links are stored in the inode, this number may
be zero.
.El
.Pp
The access-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_mode"
.It Va st_uid
The user ID of the file's owner.
.It Va st_gid
The group ID of the file.
.It Va st_mode
Status of the file (see below).
.El
.Pp
The status information word
.Fa st_mode
has the following bits:
.Bd -literal
#define S_IFMT   0170000  /* type of file mask */
#define S_IFIFO  0010000  /* named pipe (fifo) */

.Xr access 2
and
.Xr chmod 2 .
The following macros are available to test whether a
.Va st_mode
value passed in the
.Fa m

.Bl -tag -width ".Fn S_ISFIFO m"
.It Fn S_ISBLK m
Test for a block special file.
.It Fn S_ISCHR m
Test for a character special file.
.It Fn S_ISDIR m

.It Fn S_ISREG m
Test for a regular file.
.It Fn S_ISSOCK m
Test for a socket.
.It Fn S_ISWHT m

.El
.Pp
The macros evaluate to a non-zero value if the test is true
or to the value 0 if the test is false.
