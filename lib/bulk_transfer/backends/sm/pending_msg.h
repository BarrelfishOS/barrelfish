 * A simple sorted linked list for pending flounder RPC messages in the sm backend.
 * Because there is no obvious correspondence between RPC calls and replies,
 * but we have continuations to call after we get the reply,
 * we keep track of them ourselves.
 * All our flounder RPC calls and replies contain a transaction id, which is used
 * to look up the correct callback on receiving a RPC reply.
 *
 * using a linked list should be more than enough, since we don't expect many concurrent
 * pending messages.
 * the list is sorted to prevent duplicate keys
