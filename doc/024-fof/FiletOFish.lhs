  just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.\\
  So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. \\
  So I built a third one.  That burned down,
  fell over, then sank into the swamp.  \\
  But the fourth one stayed up. An' that's what your gonna get, lad -- the strongest castle in these
  islands.}{Monty Python}
