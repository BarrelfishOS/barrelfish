\emph{Skate}\footnote{Skates are cartilaginous fish belonging to the family 
Rajidae in the superorder Batoidea of rays. More than 200 species have been 
described, in 32 genera. The two subfamilies are Rajinae (hardnose skates) and 
Arhynchobatinae (softnose skates). 
Source: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_(fish)}{Wikipedia}}
is a domain specific language to describe the schema of 
Barrelfish's System Knowledge Base (SKB)~\cite{skb}. The SKB stores all 
statically or dynamically discovered facts about the system. Static facts are 
known and exist already at compile time of the SKB ramdisk or are added through
an initialization script or program. 

Examples for static facts include the device database, that associates known 
drivers with devices or the devices of a wellknown SoC. Dynamic facts, on the 
otherhand, are added to the SKB during and based on hardware discovery. 
Examples for dynamic facts include the number of processors or PCI Express 
devices. 

Inside the SKB, a prolog based constraint solver takes the added facts and 
computes a solution for hardware configuration such as PCI bridge programming,
NUMA information for memory allocation or device driver lookup. Programs can 
query the SKB using Prolog statements and obtain device configuration and PCI 
bridge programming, interrupt routing and constructing routing trees for IPC. 
Applications can use information to determine hardware characteristics such as 
cores, nodes, caches and memory as well as their affinity.


The Skate language is used to define format of those facts. The DSL is then 
compiled into a set of fact definitions and functions that are wrappers arround
the SKB client functions, in particular \texttt{skb\_add\_fact()}, to ensure
the correct format of the added facts.  

The intention when designing Skate is that the contents of system descriptor
tables such as ACPI, hardware information obtained by CPUID or PCI discovery
can be extracted from the respective manuals and easily specified in a Skate 
file. 

Skate complements the SKB by defining a \emph{schema} of the data stored in
the SKB. A schema defines facts and their structure, which is similar to Prolog
facts and their arity. A code-generation tool generates a C-API to populate the
SKB according to a specific schema instance.

The Skate compiler is written in Haskell using the Parsec parsing library. It
generates C header files from the Skate files. In addition it supports the 
generation of Schema documentation.

The source code for Skate can be found in \texttt{SOURCE/tools/skate}.


\section{Command line options}
\label{sec:cmdline}

\begin{verbatim}
$ skate <options> INFILE.skt
\end{verbatim}


Where options is one of
\begin{description}
  \item[-o] \textit{filename} The output file name
  \item[-L] generate latex documentation
  \item[-H] generate headerfile
  \item[-W] generate Wiki syntax documentation
\end{description}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Lexical Conventions}
\label{chap:lexer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Skate parser follows a similar convention as opted by modern day 
programming languages like C and Java. Hence, Skate uses a java-style-like
parser based on the Haskell Parsec Library. The following conventions are used:

\begin{description}
\item[Encoding] The file should be encoded using plain ASCII.
\item[Whitespace:]  As in C and Java, Skate considers sequences of
  space, newline, tab, and carriage return characters to be
  whitespace.  Whitespace is generally not significant. 

\item[Comments:] Skate supports C-style comments.  Single line comments
  start with \texttt{//} and continue until the end of the line.
  Multiline comments are enclosed between \texttt{/*} and \texttt{*/};
  anything inbetween is ignored and treated as white space.

\item[Identifiers:] Valid Skate identifiers are sequences of numbers
  (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character ``\texttt{\_}''.  They
  must start with a letter or ``\texttt{\_}''.  
  \begin{align*}
    identifier & \rightarrow ( letter \mid \_ ) (letter \mid digit \mid \_)^{\textrm{*}} \\
    letter & \rightarrow (\textsf{A \ldots Z} \mid  \textsf{a \ldots z})\\
    digit & \rightarrow (\textsf{0 \ldots 9})
\end{align*}

  Note that a single underscore ``\texttt{\_}'' by itself is a special,
  ``don't care'' or anonymous identifier which is treated differently
  inside the language. 
  
\item[Integer Literals:] A Skate integer literal is a sequence of
  digits, optionally preceded by a radix specifier.  As in C, decimal (base 10)
  literals have no specifier and hexadecimal literals start with
  \texttt{0x}.  Binary literals start with \texttt{0b}. 

  In addition, as a special case the string \texttt{1s} can be used to
  indicate an integer which is composed entirely of binary 1's. 

\begin{align*}
digit & \rightarrow (\textsf{0 \ldots 9})^{\textrm{1}}\\
hexadecimal & \rightarrow (\textsf{0x})(\textsf{0 \ldots 9} \mid \textsf{A \ldots F} \mid \textsf{a \ldots f})^{\textrm{1}}\\
binary & \rightarrow (\textsf{0b})(\textsf{0, 1})^{\textrm{1}}\\
\end{align*}

\item[String Literals] String literals are enclosed in double quotes and should 
  not span multiple lines.


\item[Reserved words:] The following are reserved words in Skate:
\begin{verbatim}
schema, fact, flags, constants, enumeration, text, section
\end{verbatim}


\item[Special characters:] The following characters are used as operators,
  separators, terminators or other special purposes in Skate:
\begin{alltt}

  \{ \} [ ] ( ) + - * / ; , . = 

\end{alltt}

\end{description}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Schema Declaration}
\label{chap:declaration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter we define the layout of a Skate schema file, which declarations 
it must contain and what other declarations it can have. Each Skate schema file
defines exactly one schema, which may refer to other schemas.

\section{Syntax Highlights}
In the following sections we use the syntax highlighting as follows:
\begin{syntax}
\synbf{bold}:      Keywords  
\synit{italic}:      Identifiers / strings chosen by the user
\verb+verbatim+   constructs, symbols etc
\end{syntax}



\section{Conventions}
There are a some conventions that should be followed when writing a schema 
declaration. Following the conventions ensures consistency among different
schemas and allows generating a readable and well structured documentation.

\begin{description}
    \item[Identifiers] Either camelcase or underscore can be used to separate 
    words. Identifiers must be unique i.e. their fully qualified identifier must
    be unique. A fully qualified identifier can be constructed as 
    $schema.(namespace.)*name.$
    \item[Descriptions] The description fields of the declarations should be 
    used as a more human readable representation of the identifier. No use of
    abbreviations or  
    \item[Hierarchy/Grouping] Declarations of the same concept should be grouped
    in a schema file (e.g. a single ACPI table). The declarations may be 
    grouped further using namespaces (e.g. IO or local interrupt controllers)
    \item[Sections/Text] Additional information can be provided using text 
    blocks and sections. Each declaration can be wrapped in a section. 
\end{description}

\todo{which conventions do we actually want}

\section{The Skate File}
A Skate file must consist of zero or more \emph{import} declarations (see
Section~\ref{sec:decl:schema}) followed by a single \emph{schema} declaration 
(see Section~\ref{sec:decl:schema}) which contains the actual definitions. The 
Skate file typically has the extension \emph{*.sks}, referring to a Skate (or 
SKB) schema.

\begin{syntax}
/* Header comments */
(\synbf{import} schema)*

/* the actual schema declaration */
\synbf{schema} theschema "" \verb+{+...\verb+}+
\end{syntax}

Note that all imports must be stated at the beginning of the file. Comments can
be inserted at any place.

%\begin{align*}
%    skatefile & \rightarrow ( Import )^{\textrm{*}} (Schema)
%\end{align*}

\section{Imports}\label{sec:decl:import}
An import statement makes the definitions in a different schema file
available in the current schema definition, as described below.  The
syntax of an import declaration is as follows:

\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{import} \synit{schema};
\end{syntax}

\paragraph{Fields}

\begin{description}
\item[schema] is the name of the schema to import definitions from.  
\end{description}

The order of the imports does not matter to skate. At compile time, the Skate 
compiler will try to resolve the imports by searching the include paths and the 
path of the current schema file for an appropriate schema file. Imported files 
are parsed at the same time as the main schema file. The Skate compiler will 
attempt to parse all the imports of the imported files transitively. Cyclic 
dependencies between device files will not cause errors, but at present are 
unlikely to result in C header files which will successfully compile. 

\section{Types}\label{sec:decl:types}

The Skate type system consists of a set of built in types and a set of implicit 
type definitions based on the declarations of the schema. Skate performs some
checks on the use of types.

\subsection{BuiltIn Types}

Skate supports the common C-like types such as integers, floats, chars as well 
as boolean values and Strings (character arrays). In addition, Skate treats
the Barrelfish capability reference (\texttt{struct capref}) as a built in 
type.

\begin{syntax}
    UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UIntPtr
    Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, IntPtr
    Float, Double
    Char, String
    Bool
    Capref
\end{syntax}


\subsection{Declaring Types}
All declarations stated in Section~\ref{sec:decl:decls} are implicitly types 
and can be used within the fact declarations. This can restrict the values
that are valid in a field. The syntax of the declarations enforces certain
restrictions on which types can be used in the given context. 

In particular, fact declarations allow fields to be of type fact which allows 
a notion of inheritance and common abstractions. For example, PCI devices and
USB devices may implement a specialization of the device abstraction. Note, 
cicular dependencies must be avoided.

Defining type aliases using a a C-Like typedef is currently not supported.

\section{Schema}\label{sec:decl:schema}

A schema groups all the facts of a particular topic together. For example, 
a schema could be the PCI Express devices, memory regions or an ACPI table. 
Each schema must have a unique name, which must match the name of the file, and
it must have at least one declaration to be considered a valid file. All checks
that are being executed by Skate are stated in Chapter~\ref{chap:astops}.
There can only be one schema declaration in a single Schema file.

\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{schema} \synit{name} "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
  \synit{declaration};
  \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\paragraph{Fields}

\begin{description}
\item[name] is an identifier for the Schema type, and will be used to
  generate identifiers in the target language (typically C).  
  The name of the schema \emph{must} correspond to the
  filename of the file, including case sensitivity: for example, 
  the file \texttt{cpuid.sks} will define a schema type
  of name \texttt{cpuid}. 

\item [description] is a string literal in double quotes, which
  describes the schema type being specified, for example \texttt{"CPUID 
  Information Schema"}. 

\item [declaration] must contain at least one of the following declarations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item namespace -- Section \ref{sec:decl:namespace}
        \item flags -- Section \ref{sec:decl:flags}
        \item constants -- Section \ref{sec:decl:constants}
        \item enumeration -- Section \ref{sec:decl:enums}
        \item facts -- Section \ref{sec:decl:facts}
        \item section -- Section \ref{sec:doc:section}
        \item text -- Section \ref{sec:doc:text}
    \end{itemize}

\end{description}



\section{Namespaces}
\label{sec:decl:namespace}

The idea of a namespaces is to provide more hierarchical structure similar to 
Java packages or URIs (schema.namespace.namespace) For example, a PCI devices 
may have virtual and physical functions or a processor has multiple cores. 
Namespaces can be nested within a schema to build a deeper hierarchy. 
Namespaces will have an effect on the code generation.

\todo{does everything has to live in a namespace?, or is there an implicit
default namespace?}

\paragraph{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{namespace} \synit{name} "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
    \synit{declaration};
    \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\paragraph{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the identifier of this namespace.
    
    \item[description] human readable description of this namespace
    
    \item[declarations] One or more declarations that are valid a schema 
    definition.
\end{description}



\section{Declarations}\label{sec:decl:decls}

In this section we define the syntax for the possible fact, constant, flags
and enumeration declarations in Skate. Each of the following declarations will
define a type and can be used 

\subsection{Flags}
\label{sec:decl:flags}

Flags are unsigned numbers of a specified width where each bit position has a
specific meaning. Flags are declared in a flag group which represents a single
field in the a hardware description. Example for this type are the 
\emph{LapicFlags} of the APIC entry in the ACPI MADT table. Flags are declared 
as follows:

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{flags} \synit{name} \synit{width} "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
    \synit{position1} \synit{name1} "\synit{description1}" ;
    \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the identifier of this flag group. Must be unique for all 
                declarations.
    
    \item [width] The width in bits of this flag group. Defines the maximum 
                  number of flags supported. This is one of 8, 16, 32, 64.
    
    \item [description] description in double quotes is a short explanation of
                        what the flag group represents.
    
    \item [name1] identifier of the flag. Must be unique within the flag 
                  group. 
    
    \item [position1] integer defining which bit position the flag sets
    
    \item [description1] description of this particular flag.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Type}
Flags with identifier $name$ define the following type:
\begin{syntax}
\synbf{flag} \synit{name};
\end{syntax}



\subsection{Constants}
\label{sec:decl:constants}

Compared to flags, constants can take up arbitrary values. An example of a 
constant may be the vendor ID of a PCI express device or the version number
of a generic interrupt controller. The actual constants are declared in a 
constant group which has a defined type. All constants within this group 
must have this type.

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{constants} \synit{name} \synit{builtintype} "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
    \synit{name1} = \synit{value1} "\synit{description1}" ;
    \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the identifier of this constants group. Must be unique for all 
                declarations.
    
    \item [builtintype] the type of the constant group. Must be one of the 
                        builtin types as defined in~\ref{sec:decl:types}
    
    \item [description] description in double quotes is a short explanation of
                        what the constant group represents.
    
    \item [name1] identifier of the constant. Must be unique within the 
                  constant group. 
    
    \item [value1] the value of the constant. Must match the declared type.
    
    \item [description1] description of this particular constant
    
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Type}
Constants with identifier $name$ define the following type:
\begin{syntax}
\synbf{constant} \synit{name};
\end{syntax}


\subsection{Enumerations}
\label{sec:decl:enums}

Enumerations are a special type of constants without any specific value but a 
clear defined set of values this constant can take on. This
declaration is analogue to the C style \texttt{enum} declaration.

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{enumeration} \synit{name} "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
    \synit{name1} "\synit{description1}";
    \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the identifier of this enumeration group. Must be unique for 
                all declarations.
    
    \item [description] description in double quotes is a short explanation of
                        what the enumeration group represents.
    
    \item [name1] identifier of the element. Must be unique within the 
                  enumeration group.   
    
    \item [description1] description of this particular element
    
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Type}
Enumerations with identifier $name$ define the following type:
\begin{syntax}
\synbf{enum} \synit{name};
\end{syntax}

\subsection{Facts}
\label{sec:decl:facts}

The fact is the central element of Skate. It defines the actual facts about the
system that are put into the SKB. Each fact has a name and one or more fields
of a given type. Facts should be defined such that they do not require any 
transformation. For example, take the entries of an ACPI table and define a
fact for each of the entry types. 

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{fact} \synit{name}  "\synit{description}" \verb+{+
    \synit{type1} \synit{name1} "\synit{description1}" ;
    \ldots
\verb+}+;
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the identifier of this fact. Must be unique for all 
                declarations.
    
    \item[description] description in double quotes is a short English          
                       explanation of what the fact defines. (e.g. Local APIC)
    
    \item[type1] the type of the fact field. Must be one of the BuiltIn types
                 or one of the constants, flags or other facts. When using 
                 facts as field types, there must be no recursive nesting.

    \item [name1] identifier of a fact field. Must be unique within the 
                  Fact group.   
    
    \item [description1] description of this particular field
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Type}
Facts with identifier $name$ define the following type.

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{fact} \synit{name};
\end{syntax}


\section{Documentation}

The schema declaration may contain \emph{section} and \emph{text} blocks that
allow providing an introduction or additional information for the schema 
declared in the Skate file. The two constructs are for documentation purpose 
only and do not affect code generation. The section and text blocks can appear
at any place in the Schema declaration. There is no type being defined for 
documentation blocks.

\subsection{Schema}
The generated documentation will contain all the schemas declared in the source 
tree. The different schema files correspond to chapters in the resulting 
documentation or form a page of a Wiki for instance.

\subsection{Text}
\label{sec:doc:text}

By adding \texttt{text} blocks, additional content can be added to the generated
documentation. This includes examples and additional information of the
declarations of the schema. The text blocks are omitted when generating code. 
Note, each of the text lines must be wrapped in double quotes. Generally, a 
block of text will translate to a paragraph.

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{text} \verb+{+
    "\synit{text}"
    ...
\verb+};+
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[text] A line of text in double quotes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Sections}
\label{sec:doc:section}
The \texttt{section} construct allows to insert section headings into the 
documentation. A section logically groups the declarations and text blocks 
together to allow expressing a logical hierarchy. 

\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{syntax}
\synbf{section} "\synit{name}"  \verb+{+
    \synit{declaration};
    \ldots
\verb+};+
\end{syntax}

\subsubsection{Fields}

\begin{description}
    \item[name] the name will be used as the section heading
    \item[declaration] declarations belonging to this section. 
\end{description}

Note, nested sections will result into (sub)subheadings or heading 2, 3, ...
Namespaces will appear as sections in the documentation.

For each schema specification, Skate generates ....

\paragraph{Abbrevations}
In all the sections of this chapter, we use the follwing abbrevations, where 
the actual value may be upper or lower case depending on the conventions:

\begin{description}
  \item[SN] The schema name as used in the schema declaration.
  \item[DN] The declaration name as used in the flags / constants / 
            enumeration / facts declaration
  \item[FN] The field name as used in field declaration of flags / constants / 
            enumeration / facts
\end{description}

In general all defined functions, types and macros are prefixed with the schema
name SN.

\paragraph{Conventions}
We use the follwing conventions for the generated code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item macro definitions and enumerations are uppercase.
  \item type definitions, function names are lowercase.
  \item use of the underscore \texttt{'\_'} to separate words
\end{itemize}

\todo{just a header file (cf mackerel), or also C functions (cf. flounder)?}

\section{Using Schemas}

Developers can use the schemas by including the generated header file of a 
schema. All header files are placed in the schema subdirectory of the main 
include folder of the build tree. For example, the 
schema \texttt{SN} would generate the file \texttt{SN\_schema.h} and can 
be included by a C program with:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\#include <schema/SN\_schema.h}
\end{quote}

\section{Preamble}

The generated headerfile is protected by a include guard that depends on the
schema name. For example, the schema \texttt{SN} will be guarded by the
macro definition \texttt{\_\_SCHEMADEF\_\_SN\_H\_}. The header file will 
include the folling header files:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a common header \texttt{skate.h} providing the missing macro and 
        function definitions for correct C generation.
  \item an include for each of the imported schema devices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Constants}

For any declared constant group, Skate will generate the following:

\paragraph{Type and macro definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A type definition for the declared type of the constant group. The 
        type  typename will be \texttt{SN\_DN\_t}.
  \item A set of CPP macro definitions, one for each of the declared constants.
        Each macro will have the name as in \texttt{SN\_DN\_FN} and expands to the field value cast to the type of the field.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Function definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function to describe the value 
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{SN\_DN\_describe(SN\_DN\_t);}
        \end{quote}

  \item An snprintf-like function to pretty-print values of type SN\_DN\_t, 
        with prototype:
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{int SN\_DN\_print(char *s, size\_t sz);}
        \end{quote}

\end{enumerate}
\todo{Do we need more ?}

\section{Flags}

\paragraph{Type and macro definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A type definition for the declared type of the flag group. The 
        type typename will be \texttt{SN\_DN\_t}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Function definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function to describe the value 
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{SN\_DN\_describe(SN\_DN\_t);}
        \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
\todo{Do we need more ?}

\section{Enumerations}
Enumerations translate one-to-one to the C enumeration type in a straight 
forward manner:

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{typdef enum \{ SN\_DN\_FN1, ... \} SN\_DN\_t; }
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Function definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function to describe the value 
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{SN\_DN\_describe(SN\_DN\_t);}
        \end{quote}
  \item A function to pretty-print the value
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{SN\_DN\_print(char *b, size\_t sz, SN\_DN\_t val);}
        \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Facts}


\paragraph{Type and macro definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A type definition for the declared type of the flag group. The 
        type typename will be \texttt{SN\_DN\_t}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Function definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function to describe the value 
        \begin{quote}
          \texttt{SN\_DN\_describe(SN\_DN\_t);}
        \end{quote}
  \item A function to add a fact to the SKB
  \item A function to retrieve all the facts of this type from the SKB
  \item A function to delete the fact from the SKB
\end{enumerate}

\todo{Provide some way of wildcard values. e.g. list all facts with this 
filter or delete all facts that match the filter.}

\section{Namespaces}

\paragraph{Function definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A function to retrieve all the facts belonging to a name space
\end{enumerate}


\section{Sections and text blocks}
For the \texttt{section} and \texttt{text} blocks in the schema file, there
won't be any visible C constructs generated, but rather turned into comment
blocks in the generated C files.

Each fact added to the SKB using Skate is represented by a single Prolog
functor.  The functor name in Prolog consist of the schema and fact name.  The
fact defined in Listing \ref{lst:sample_schema} is represented by the functor
\lstinline!cpuid_vendor!~and has an arity of three.

on the level of schema or namespaces.


\chapter{Integration into the Hake build system}

Skate is a tool that is integrated with Hake. Add the attribute
\lstinline!SkateSchema!~to a Hakefile to invoke Skate as shown in Listing
\ref{lst:Skate_hake}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Including Skate schemata in Hake},
label={lst:Skate_hake}, language=Haskell]
[ build application {
    SkateSchema = [ "cpu" ]
    ... 
} ]
\end{lstlisting}

Adding an entry for \varname{SkateSchema} to a Hakefile will generate both
header and implementation and adds it to the list of compiled resources. A
Skate schema is referred to by its name and Skate will look for a file
ending with \varname{.Skate} containing the schema definition.

The header file is placed in \pathname{include/schema} in the build tree, the C
implementation is stored in the Hakefile application or library directory.
