\chapter{Introduction}

This note describes how to build and boot Barrelfish on 64-bit PC
hardware, which is the default configuration for Barrelfish.  It then
goes on to work through a simple ``hello, world''-style application
which illustrates client-server programming in C on Barrelfish, and
the use of the message-passing subsystem.

Information on how to compile Barrelfish for other platforms, in
particular ARM, are found in other documents.  However, the
application programming section in this guide is still relevant.
