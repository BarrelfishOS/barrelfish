<h1>
Topic: Cyclic (and deeply nested) terms</h1>
Involved: Joachim, Warwick
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Problem</h2>
Eclipse up to 5.2 at least contains a number of C routines that recurse
over Prolog terms. E.g.
<ul>
<li>
groundness test</li>

<li>
term_variables</li>

<li>
compare_terms</li>

<li>
occurs test</li>

<li>
copy term</li>

<li>
copy to heap</li>

<li>
term write operations</li>
</ul>
Most of them have "last subterm optimization" implemented, i.e. they don't
build up a call stack when traversing right-balanced structures and in
particular lists. However, for deep non-right-balanced structures, and
for cyclic structures, we get overflows of the C call stack, which cannot
be caught easily (they manifest themselves as segfaults or the like).
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Solutions</h2>

<h3>
Catch overflows</h3>
Use a PDL (push down list) as in the emulator unification/difference routine
or in the garbage collector marking. This PDL is built in the local stack,
so overflow can be properly detected and caught.
<p>Other possibility: introduce a global "nesting depth limit", count depth
in all the critical routines, and report error on exceeding the limit.
<h3>
Detect cycles</h3>
There are rather obvious ways to detect cycles by destructively marking
the visited parts of the term.
<p>But here is a cheap, non-destructive algorithm for cycle detection:
<ul>
<li>
Maintain one address within the term that has already been visited (call
it <b>crumb</b>).</li>

<li>
Maintain a <b>step counter</b> that counts steps since leaving the crumb.</li>

<li>
have a <b>step counter limit</b>, initialized to an arbitrary value (e.g.
2 or more)</li>

<li>
When encoutering crumb<b> </b>again during term traversal, we have a cycle
and stop.</li>

<li>
When step counter exceeds step counter limit before having encountered
crumb:</li>

<ol>
<li>
set crumb to current address</li>

<li>
reset step counter to zero</li>

<li>
double step counter limit</li>
</ol>
</ul>
This will eventually (but possibly quite late) detect a cycle if one exists.
Why? Assume the traversal has entered a cycle. When step counter reaches
step counter limit before encountering crumb, that means:
<ul>
<li>
either crumb is outside the cycle. Therefore we set crumb to the current
address, so it will be in the cycle from now on.</li>

<li>
or the cycle is longer than the step limit. Therefore we double the step
limit, so it will eventually be long enough to detect the cycle.</li>
</ul>
