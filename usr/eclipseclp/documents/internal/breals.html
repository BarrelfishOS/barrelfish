<h1>
The bounded real (breal) data type</h1>
Involved: Joachim, Warwick
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
What is it?</h2>
A new type of number in Eclipse: a representation of a <b>real</b> as a
pair of <b>floating point bounds</b>. While a <b>float</b> conceptually
stands for a real that is somewhere <i>in the vicinity of</i> the float,
a breal stands for a real that is somewhere <i>between the given bounds</i>.
To keep terminology precise, we decided on the name <b>bounded real</b>
rather than <i>interval</i> or <i>ground interval</i> - the latter would
have invited confusion with interval variables.
<h2>
Features</h2>
Predicates
<ul>
<li>
breal/1 type test</li>

<li>
breal/2 conversion to breal</li>

<li>
breal_min/2, breal_max/2, breal_bounds/3 get the bounds as a float</li>
</ul>
Syntax
<ul>
<li>
two floats separated by two underscores, e.g. 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Trick to convert all float constants into breals:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- local macro(type(float),breal/2,[]).
Yes (0.00s cpu)

?- X = 3.4.
X = 3.3999999999999995__3.4000000000000004
Yes (0.00s cpu)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Problems</h2>
There are a number of rather fundamental problems associated to the idea
of having reals in a programming language. No programming language can
have exact representations for all reals - they are uncountable. Any one
program can only deal with a countable subset of them.
<p>Since there are uncountably many reals but only countably many names/representations,
an infinite number of reals share the same representation.
<p>Some of the usual generic Prolog properties are violated:
<ul>
<li>
equality (and unifiability) is not decidable even if the breals look the
same:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<pre>?- breal(3.1,X), breal(3.1,Y), X==Y.
exiting to an undefined tag in exit_block('undecidable comparison of bounded reals')</pre>

<pre>?- breal(3.1,X), Y is sin(X), Z is sin(X), Y==Z.&nbsp;&nbsp;
exiting to an undefined tag in exit_block('undecidable comparison of bounded reals')
</pre>
</ul>

<li>
except in special cases:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<pre>[eclipse 2]: breal(3.1,X), X==X.
X = 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005
Yes (0.00s cpu)</pre>
</ul>

<li>
the rule that you can writeq a term, read it back, and it will be identical
to the written one does not hold (because there is no unique finite representation
for every individual real - we would need a universal dictionary of all
reals ever written)</li>

<li>
same holds for storing breals elsewhere:</li>

<ul>
<pre>?- breal(3.1,X), findall(Y, Y=X, [X]).
exiting to an undefined tag in exit_block('undecidable comparison of bounded reals')
</pre>
</ul>

<li>
the arithmetic comparisons leave a delayed goal:</li>

<ul>
<pre>?-&nbsp; breal(3.1,X), breal(3.1,Y), X=:=Y.

X = 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005
Y = 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005


Delayed goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005 =:= 3.0999999999999996__3.1000000000000005
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>
So why do all these problems not occur with floats? They do, of course,
they are just fudged.
