<h1>Compile Time Transforms in IC</h1>
<ol>
<li>Factor out all blatantly non-linear sub-expressions, replacing
them with a place-holder temporary variable.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Non-linear sub-expressions are divisions <code>'/'/2</code>,
  embedded reified constraint terms eg.<code>*=/2</code> and all
  functions except <code>eval/1</code>.</li>

  <li>Products <code>*/2</code> are <em>not</em> factored out.</li>

  <li>Recursively transform all factored sub-expressions.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>If the remaining expression is linear, then transform it into a
specialised propagator.
  <ul>
  <li><code>X =:= Y</code> becomes nothing, but the valiables are
  unifed <code>X = Y</code> at compile time</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>If the remaining expression is <em>not</em> linear, then delay
processing until run-time.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Compile time linear</h3>

<code>X =:= 3 * A + 4 * B</code> becomes <code>ic_lin_eq/3</code><br>

<code>X =:= 1 + 3 * A</code> becomes <code>ic_2v_eq/6</code><br>

<code>X =:= 3 * A</code> becomes <code>ic_1v_eq/4</code><br>

<h3>Compile time maybe linear</h3>

<code>X =:= A + eval(E)</code> becomes <code>X =:= A + E</code> and is
re-processed at run-time. Note the removal of the <code>eval/1</code>
wrapper.<br>

<code>X =:= A + B*C</code> becomes <code>X =:= A + B*C</code> (ie is
left allone sice it contains variable products)<br>

<h3>Compile time linear after factoring</h3>

<code>X =:= 1 + A + 2*B + sin(C + 3*D)</code> becomes
<code>ic_lin_eq(T2 =:= C + 3*D)</code>, <code>T1 iis sin(T2)</code>,
<code>ic_lin_eq(X =:= 1 + A + 2*B + T1)</code>

<h3>Compile time maybe linear after factoring</h3>

<code>X =:= 1 + A*sin(C + 3*D)</code> becomes <code>ic_lin_eq(T2 =:= C
+ 3*D)</code>, <code>T1 iis sin(T2)</code>, <code>X =:= 1 +
A*T1</code>. Note that what is left of the original constraint will
be re-processed at run-time.

<h3>Compile time clearly non-linear</h3>

<code>X =:= sin(Y)</code> becomes <code>X iis sin(Y)</code>.  Note
there will be a temporary form where <code>X =:= T1</code> and
<code>T1 iis sin(Y)</code>, but <code>X =:= T1</code> will be
collapsed to nothing and the variables <code>X</code> and
<code>T1</code> will be unified at compile time, resulting in <code>X
iis sin(Y)</code>
