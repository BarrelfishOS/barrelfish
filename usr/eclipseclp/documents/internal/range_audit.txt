Audit performed with main branch sources current as of 2002-11-28; sources
tagged with tag range_dependency_audit.

Deleted icparc_solvers/range.pl and removed from the Makefile.
    The only compilation problems were in icparc_solvers:
	eplex_with_range.ecl
	range_eplex.ecl
	eplex_relax.pl
	eplex_cplex.pl
	eplex_xpress.pl
	probing_for_scheduling.pl
	probe.pl
	probe_search.pl
	    Aborted with library not found in eplex_.ecl.

	ria.pl
	    Aborted with library not found.

	make_overlap_bivs.pl
	probe_support.pl
	    Aborted with library not found in probe_support.pl.

    Also problems generating documentation:
	eplex.pl
	fdplex.pl
	mip.pl

Ran the tests ignoring the above problems.
    The following tests had problems:
	Bips - bips
	Bips - bipsi
	    There are 10 tests to do with get_var_bounds and set_var_bounds
	    which use ria and/or range.

	Libraries - libraries
	    Test noted the missing/problematic libraries:
		eplex
		eplex_cplex
		eplex_relax
		eplex_xpress
		fdplex
		make_overlap_bivs
		mip
		probe
		probe_search
		probe_support
		probing_for_scheduling
		range
		range_eplex
		ria
	    Test also noted that propia refers to the range library.

	Eplex - mipex
	Eplex - pool_mipex
	    Tests failed to load the range library; OK, because IC versions
	    of tests exist.

	Eplex - pool_ic_mipex
	    This test appears to still be using (the non-IC version of)
	    eplex!

	Retimer - retimer
	ProbingForScheduling - probing_for_scheduling
	BRG - brg
	    No IC version of these tests.

	Visualisation - vc_support
	    Has some ria and eplex tests which don't have IC counterparts
	    (though there are some other IC tests).

    Apart from the above, the following tests generated warning output:
	Propia - propia_fd
	Propia - propia_ic
	    Refers to non-existing module range.
	    Might have been worth having some propia_range tests, but not
	    much point any more.

Modified eplex.pl to make ic_eplex the default.
Updated Retimer and BRG code, tests and results files to use ic/ic_kernel
instead of range.
    Retimer and BRG tests now pass.

ProbingForScheduling tests need the probing libraries updated for ic_eplex
before they can be re-tested.


Summary
-------

The following libraries currently do not support IC-based solving and do not
have corresponding IC versions:

	eplex_relax.pl
	make_overlap_bivs.pl
	mip.pl
	probe.pl
	probe_search.pl
	probe_support.pl
	probe_support.pl
	probing_for_scheduling.pl

Some of these are only problematic because they depend on one or more of the
others.  It is assumed there is no need to provide an IC-based version of
fdplex.pl.  The only other outstanding piece of missing functionality
appears to be the piecewise linear constraint not being available for IC
yet.
