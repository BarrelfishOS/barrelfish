How to deal with a new XPRESS release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Author: joachim
Date: Mar 2002


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing at IC-Parc
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a directory for the new release under /usr/local/eclipse (alias
Members/Eclipse), named xosl1310 for example for version 13.10.

	mkdir /usr/local/eclipse/xosl1310
	chgrp eclipse /usr/local/eclipse/xosl1310
	chmod g+s /usr/local/eclipse/xosl1310

Make subdirectories for

	i386_nt/
		move the bin,lib,include directories from the CD here
		make a symbolic link xprs1310.lib -> xprs.lib

	i386_linux/
		unpack unix/linux.tar from the CD here

	sparc_sunos5/
		unpack unix/sparc.tar from the CD here


If it doesn't exist yet, make also a directory for the major release:

	mkdir /usr/local/eclipse/xosl13
	chgrp eclipse /usr/local/eclipse/xosl13
	chmod g+s /usr/local/eclipse/xosl13

and create or update the following subdirectories:

	docs
		the docs directory from the CD

	examples
		the examples directory from the CD
		
	lic_default/{i386_nt,i386_linux,sparc_sunos5}
		move the student version license files here (see below)

	lic/{i386_nt,i386_linux,sparc_sunos5}
		put IC-Parc's license files (xpress.pwd) here
		these are not on the CD but normally sent by email


License files (applies to version 13):

	STUDENT VERSION LICENSE FILESD SEEM TO BE NO LONGER ON THE CD!

	Move the student files to lic_default/$ARCH:

	for ARCH in i386_nt i386_linux sparc_sunos5; do
	    mkdir lic_default/$ARCH
	    mv <whereever>/xpress.pwd lic_default/$ARCH
	done

	Note that the icparc_solvers/Makefile picks the student files
	up from there and copies them into the Eclipse distribution.


Permissions:

	chmod -R ug+rwX,o=rX /usr/local/eclipse/xosl1310



----------------------------------------------------------------------
Making the new configuration for the Windows build:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Visual C developer studio:

    Build->Configurations:
	add new configurations Debug1310 and Release1310

    Edit project setting for the new configurations:

    	General:
	    intermediate files and output file to Debug/Release1310

    	C/C++,Preprocessor:
	    update XPRESS and XPRESSMINOR setting
	    update include directory name

    	Link:
	    update .lib file name (e.g. xprs1310.lib) and check whether
	    	that file (symbolic link) exists
	    update lib directory name

    	Post build:
	    update the directory and file names


Then try to build and test. Once everything works:

    Project->export makefile

    Save workspace

Then go to the cvs directory Eclipse/WinMSC/EplexXpress:

    Edit EplexXpress.mak and replace all occurrences of
    	\SomeDirName\WinMSC\Eclipse
    with
    	..\Eclipse

    Look at the diffs of EplexXpress.dsp and EplexXpress.mak.
    Occasionally, VC studio decides to restructure the .mak file quite
    substantially, this is normally ok.

Edit BUILD_ROTD to add the new configuration(s).
