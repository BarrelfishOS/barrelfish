% Use list_operators.pl to generate the table
%

The following table summarises the predefined global operators in {\eclipse}.
\index{operators}
They can be redefined or erased on a per-module basis by hiding them
with a user-defined local operator using
\bipref{op/3}{../bips/kernel/syntax/op-3.html}.
