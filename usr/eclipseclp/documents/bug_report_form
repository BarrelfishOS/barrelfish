                How to report problems in ECLiPSe
                ---------------------------------

If you want to report a problem, first make sure that it is really
a bug in the system and not in your program or in your interpretation
of the ECLiPSe functionality.  If you are not sure whether you have
found a bug, here are some guidelines:
 
- The messages

        Segmentation violation - maybe machine stack overflow
        Aborting execution....

        Spurious interrupt in protected code!!!
        Trying to abort...

  always indicate a bug (unless you have loaded buggy external C code).
 
- Equally, all 'internal' messages like

        Compiler internal error: file "body.c":303

	GC internal error: ...

  and similar ones indicate an ECLiPSe bug.
 
- If you supply bad mode declarations, the behaviour of your program
  is undefined. This is not a bug.
 
 
We can fix your problem only if we are able to reproduce it.  This
means that it is _absolutely_necessary_ to include a script which
shows, from the beginning of an ECLiPSe session, what is to be done
to make the problem appear.  Vague statements like "I have found a bug
in the assert predicate" or "the setval/2 predicate crashes when
I store a ground term more than 50 times" are of little use for us.
 
Note on large applications: In general, you help us if you try to
narrow down the problem.  Especially if your program just fails or
gives wrong solutions, it is very difficult for us to find where
something goes wrong as we are not familiar with your program.

If you find a problem that occurs only if your program is compiled
in the nodbgcomp (or only in dbgcomp) mode, please try to isolate
the predicate(s) for which the compilation mode is significant.

In order to report a bug, please fill in the following form (in English)
and e-mail it to eclipse-bugs@icparc.ic.ac.uk
