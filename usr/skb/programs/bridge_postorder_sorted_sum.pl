% the PCI tree is constructed by adding child devices to the bridge. all the
% children are sorted by the requesting size of the children in descending order.
% on the next level children (which include subordinate bridges) are sorted by
% the sum of all  children below the bridge.
% the bridges Sz variable contains therefore the sum of the requesting sizes of
% all children. like this, we can allocate resources
% for the biggest requesting bridge and all its children first.
