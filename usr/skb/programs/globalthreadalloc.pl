%Regla
% 1. #Threads <= Nr (z.Bsp. minimale Blockgroesse pro Thread)
% 2. #Threads >= Nr
% 3. Wenn Blockgroesse < Cachelinegroesse => Threads auf HT gruppieren
% 4. Wenn Threads auf Puffer operieren ((de-)codieren, maplist,...)
%    dann HTs benutzen
% 5. Wenn Threads intensive Berechnungen von wenigen Variablen durchfuehren,
%    dann echte Cores benutzen (ev. zweiter HT als Mem-Prefetcher benutzen)
% 6. Global: Sporadische Threads gruppieren, Threads die lange im System
%    bleiben und lange auf gleichem Puffer arbeiten (Netzwerk, Server)
%    als eigene Gruppe auf #Cores gruppieren
% 7. Services bauen: OpenSSL-Service, der AES-Ver- und -Entschluesselung
%    anbietet und dadurch lange im System bleibt und weiss, wo wann welche
%    Threads zum Einsatz kommen
% 8. Allen Services jeweils sagen, dass sie jetzt so und so viele Threads
%    auf diesen und diesen Cores benutzen koennen
% 9. User-Apps, die schnell kommen und gehen auf Cores gruppieren

%10. Applikation soll definieren, welche Threads miteinander kommunizieren
%    oder synchronisieren. Algo hier soll dann diese Threads moeglichst
%    nahe voneinander plazieren.

%11. Applikation soll definieren, dass sie nur auf Core, der bla unterstuetzt,
%    laufen kann (beispielsweise einer, der FPU hat). Algo soll entsprechend
%    nur diese Cores auswaehlen

%12. Algo soll FPU threads moeglichst auf verschiedene Cores setzen, damit das
%    Betriebssystem keinen FPU-Kontext-Switch machen muss. Dieser wird
%    nur on-demand by FPU-Exception (interrupt) gemacht, falls neuer Thread
%    nach Switch das erstemal FPU-Instruktion ausfuehrt. Wenn man nur einen
%    Thread pro Core mit FPU-Instruktionen laufen laesst, muss nie FPU-Exception
%    behandelt werden.
