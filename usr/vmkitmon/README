VMKIT README
============

The monitor needs two files to run. A GRUB stage 2 image and a disk image with
the guest installed. The disk image hast to be readable by GRUB, of course. The
files are loaded via NFS and their location can be configured in vmkitmon.c.

NOTE I: VMkit does only support a trivial BIOS disk. No real virtual disk
controller is implemented. Therefore, the guest disk image has to be configured
to load everything relevant into RAM before invoking the guest kernel.

NOTE II: VMkit does not compile in cmake debug mode atm. The RBP register is
accessed when saving and restoring the guest's state. The standard
"RelWithDebInfo" works.

The construction of the disk image:

The image is composed of a partition table and a partition (hd0,0) with an ext3 
filesystem containing the GRUB menu.lst (in the boot/grub directory as 
specified in the GRUB stage 2 image), the Linux kernel, initramfs, and other 
pertinent files, which can be accessed in a relatively simple manner by using 
loop devices in Linux:

losetup /dev/loop0 system-bench.img
losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop1 /dev/loop0
mk -t ext3 /dev/loop1
mount -t ext3 /dev/loop1 /mnt/example

The offset 32256, the start sector of the partition multiplied by the sector 
size (in bytes), is obtained by using a disk partitioning utility/application 
such as fdisk or cfdisk. In this case, the start sector is 63 and the sector 
size is 512 bytes.


GRUB
====

The GRUB stage 2 used is compiled with a compiled in menu list
(--enable-preset-menu configure option) of:

serial --unit=0 --speed=115200 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1
terminal --timeout=0 serial
default 0
timeout 0
title Load config from (hd0,0)
configfile (hd0,0)/boot/grub/menu.lst

The terminal and serial part is important. Otherwise GRUB will try to access the
video console which will result in unhandled BIOS calls.

The menu list that I used (on sbrinz1 and sbrinz2) was:

timeout 0
title   Barrelfish
root    (nd)
kernel  /sandrinr/kernel loglevel=3 logmask=0
module  /sandrinr/init
module  /sandrinr/mem_serv
module  /sandrinr/monitor bootcpus=0-1
module  /sandrinr/chips
module  /sandrinr/serial
module  /sandrinr/lpc_timer
module  /sandrinr/skb
module  /sandrinr/pci
module  /sandrinr/e1000n core=1
module  /sandrinr/vmkitmon


Linux
=====

Linux does not believe the memory map reported by VMkit (INT 15, AX 0xe820).
It is pretty primitive and should possibly be altered to reflect something
similar as reported by QEMU.
As a workaround, the Linux kernel parameters "mem=2G memmap=640K@0 memmap=1999M@1M"
can be used.

The Linux kernel parameters used for the test system are:
"edd=off noapic nolapic noirqbalance acpi=off pci=off noisapnp nousb
mem=2G memmap=640K@0 memmap=1999M@1M console=ttyS0,115200 1"
It is possible that not everything is necessary. I just put everything in there
i found to disable unsupported core subsystems.
