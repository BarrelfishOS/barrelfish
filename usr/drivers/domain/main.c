/**
 * \file
 * \brief Driver domain example.
 *
 * Implements a simple driver domain. This domain does two things:
 *
 * (a) it prints all the driver modules found
 *     There are a three things necessary for the driver module system to work:
 *     - A custom ELF section in the driver domain called .bfdrivers where
 *       all bfdriver structs are located.
 *     - A linker script that defines the section and two symbols
 *       `bfdrivers_start` and `bfdrivers_end` that mark the end and beginning
 *       of the section.
 *     - A special way to link the driver modules (using addModules) in hake,
 *       which makes sure the symbols are included in the binary without explicitly
 *       referencing them.
 *     For more information on how works, check the driverkit.h file as well
 *     along with modules.c in lib/driverkit.
 *
 * (b) it connects to the driver domain controller (Kaluga) and makes
 *     sure it handles it's requests (defined in ddomain.if) to create,
 *     destroy driver instances.
 *     The corresponding code for (b) is found in the driverkit library
 *     specifically in file ddomain_service.c
